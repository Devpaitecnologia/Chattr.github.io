Jessup Cellars wines are carefully crafted with the help of our\n renowned consulting winemaker Rob Lloyd who famously crafted Chardonnay for Rombauer, La Crema\n and Cakebread. Not only has Rob created one of the best Chardonnays in the Napa Valley with our 2022\nvintage, but has also helped curate 'The Art of the Blend' with our stellar red wines.\n Jessup Cellars Team\n VOTED MOSTFRIENDLY &KNOWLEDGEABLESTAFF4YEARSINAROW!\n Over the past several years, Jessup Cellars has won numerous awards including CellarPass’ ‘Friendliest\n & Most Knowledgeable Staff’ three years in a row, Napa Valley Life magazine’s ‘Best Wine Club’ and,\n recently, Yountville’s ‘Business of the Year’.\n https://jessupcellars.com/reviews/\n Rob Lloyd Consulting Winemaker\n BIOGRAPHY\n Hometown: All of California\n Favorite Jessup Wine Pairing: Carneros Chardonnay with freshly caught Mahi-Mahi\n About: Rob’s foray into wine started directly after graduating college when he came to Napa to work in a\n tasting room for the summer– before getting a ‘real job’. He became fascinated with wine and the science\n of winemaking and began to learn everything he could about the process.\n While interviewing for that “real job”, the interviewer asked him what he had been doing with his time\n since graduation. After speaking passionately and at length about wine, the interviewer said, “You seem\n to love that so much. Why do you want this job?” Rob realized he didn't want it, actually. He thanked the\n man, and thus began a career in the wine industry.\n Rob has since earned his MS in Viticulture & Enology from the University of California Davis and worked\n for many prestigious wineries including Cakebread, Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars, and La Crema. Rob began\n crafting Jessup Cellars in the 2009 season and took the position of Director of Winemaking at Jessup\n Cellars in 2010. He now heads up our winemaking for the Good Life Wine Collective, which also includes\n Handwritten Wines\n Bernardo Munoz Winemaker\n BIOGRAPHY\n Hometown: Campeche, Mex\n Favorite Jessup Wine Pairing: 2010 Manny’s Blend with Mongolian Pork Chops from Mustards Grill\nrichness paired with richness\n About: Bernardo began his career in the vineyards, learning the intricacies of grape growing and how to\n adjust to the whims of Mother Nature. He then moved into the cellars at Jessup Cellars, bringing us his\n complete grape to bottle knowledge to the team. He has a keen understanding of what it takes to make a\n great bottle.\n White Wine\n Our leading white wine is our Napa Valley Chardonnay from the Los Carneros region. The Truchard\n Vineyard is perfectly located in the hills above Highway 12 with the San Francisco Bay influences creating\n a cooler growing climate where the grapes ripen slowly and perfectly on the vine. The perfect weather\n combines with an ideal terroir to create the foundation for a well-balanced Chardonnay aged for 10\n months in 40% new American Oak barrels. We also offer an annual harvest of Sauvignon Blanc which is\n sourced from North Coast vines outside of the Napa Valley. The tropical nature of our 2023 Sauvignon\n Blanc is decidedly different than the typical Sauvignon Blanc grown in the Valley and elsewhere in the\n World. Due to its limited supply this wine sells out quickly each year so be sure to give us a call before\n visiting our tasting room to check availability.\n The Jessup Cellars 2022 Chardonnay is a white wine that comes across as very well balanced due to the\n aging being done in a combination of 40% new American and 60% neutral American Oak. This brings\n hints of oak to the wine while also offering a slightly creamy mouth feel without being a butter bomb. Our\n Napa Valley Chardonnay is a member favorite while the non-member price of $55 is appreciated by\n enthusiasts of this quality wine crafted by Rob Lloyd. The alcohol content is 14.8% while the PH is 3.4.\nOur sold out 2023 100% Sauvignon Blanc vintage is sourced from North Coast vineyards aged in 100%\n stainless steel barrels which is typical for this varietal. The stainless steel seals out the oxygen and seals\n in the flavors of the fruit and is a hearty 15.1% alcohol content with a PH of 3.3. While it's nose and\n flavors hint at tropical delights, we would not consider this wine to be too fruit forward, but rather fruit\n balanced with hints of pineapple and mango. Our Sauvignon Blanc is the perfect hot tub wine or for those\n warm summer evenings after a long day in the hot summer Sun. You will feel refreshed after enjoying a\n glass or two of our Sauvignon Blanc, non-member price of $45!\n The 2023 Sauvignon Blanc pairs wonderfully with a variety of dishes, enhancing the dining experience.\n For starters, it complements the flavors of Grilled Prawn Cocktail and Ceviche, accentuating the seafood's\n delicate taste and brightening the citrus elements in the dishes. The wine's fruity and floral notes\n beautifully complement the freshness of Tacos, making it an ideal match for this flavorful and versatile\n Mexican dish. Lastly, the wine's high acidity and fruit-forward character provide a delightful contrast to the\n creamy sweetness of a Peach & Burrata salad, creating a harmonious and memorable pairing.\n Red Wine\n Jessup Cellars offers a number of red wines across a range of varietals, from Pinot Noir and Merlot\n blends from the Truchard Vineyard, to blended Cabernet Sauvignon from both the Napa and Alexander\n Valleys, our Mendocino Rougette combining Grenache and Carignan varietals which we refer to as our\n 'Summer Red', to the ultimate expression of the 'Art of the Blend\" with our Juel and Table for Four Red\n Wines. We also offer 100% Zinfandel from 134 year old vines in the Mendocino region and our own 100%\n Petite Sirah grown in the Wooden Valley in Southeastern Napa County. We also offer some seasonal\n favorites, led by the popular whimsical Manny's Blend which should be released later in 2024 with a very\n special label.\n What makes our Pinot Noir unique from typical Pinot is the added element of the Jessup 'Art of the Blend'.\n While it is 96.7% Pinot Noir with fruit sourced from our favorite Los Carneros Truchard Vineyard, our\n master winemakers blend in a little (3.3%) of our own Petite Sirah from our estate vineyard in the Wooden\n Valley area of Southeastern Napa County and age it in 50% new French oak for 10 months The alcohol\n content of this vintage is 14.8% with a PH of 3.45.This gives our 2021 Pinot Noir a much bolder color,\n very different from your typical light and bright Pinot you may be accustomed to. This also adds body to\n the wine which has become a member favorite at Jessup Cellars, priced at $70 for non-members.\n Jessup Cellars 2019 Rougette is the perfect blend of Spanish varietals including 87% Grenache and 13%\n Carignane, both coming from our Mendocino growing region which is particularly suited for what we refer\n to as our 'Summer Red'. This beautiful wine of co-fermented Grenache and Carignan varieties greets you\n with opulent aromas of sweet strawberry, ripe cranberry jam, red plum, cassis, and nutmeg. We aghe this\n wine by co-fermenting the varietals for 15 months in used (neutral) Chardonnay barrels and delivers a\n 14.9% alcohol content with a PH of 3.35. The non-member price is $60. The palate is wonderfully dry and\n lifted with fresh acidity and silky, rich tannins. Flavors of brambly, ripe fruit make this wine exceptionally\n palatable and food-friendly. Enjoy it with duck confit, mushroom risotto or an assortment of softer\n cheeses. Drink now or cellar 2-3 years.\n Jessup Cellars has a history of making fine big Zinfandels, but the 2020 Pacini Vineyards 100% Zinfandel\n from the Talmage Bench in Mendocino County is decidedly different than your typical Zin, with the grapes\n for this wine coming from 134 year old \"ancient vines\". Brimming with nuances of ripe cranberry,\n pomegranate, cherry cola, white pepper, and vanilla, this wine offers soft tannins with a nice, long finish.\n This wine is aged in used (neutral) Chardonnay barrels with an alcohol content of 14.9%. The price is $60\n for non-members Pair with pastas, barbequed meats or just pour yourself a glass and enjoy on its own.\n Drink now after decanting or age for up to 9 years.\n Our 2019 Jessup Cellars Merlot is from the Truchard Vineyard in the Los Carneros region of the Napa\n Valley which enjoys the San Francisco Bay influences that also envelope our Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.\nThe terroir is ideally suited for a full bodied Merlot and like many of our wines, our Merlot is reflective of\n the 'Art of the Blend' by our winemakers. The 2019 Merlot is 80% Merlot, 16.5% Cabernet Sauvignon\n from the Chiles Valley AVA in Northeastern Napa County and a splash of our Petite Sirah (3.5%) from the\n same location finishes the wine perfectly. Our merlot is aged for 22 months in 40% new American/French\n oak with an alcohol content of 15.1% with a PH level of 3.55. This wine drinks well now, however, will\n continue to age gracefully for another 5-8 years. We recommend trying this delicious Merlot with roasted\n chicken and vegetables or beef bourguignon. Non-members can pick up our 2019 Napa Valley Merlot for\n $70.\n Jessup’s Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon is a staple of most Napa Valley winemakers with Jessup\n offering our 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon for 2024. As with most of our red wines, our winemakers exercise\n 'The Art of the Blend' by starting with 90% Napa Valley fruit from the Chiles Valley AVA in Northeastern\n Napa County, then blend in 5% Petite Sirah from the same AVA, 3% Merlot from our Truchard Vineyard in\n the Los Carneros region, then finish it with 2.1% Cabernet Franc, which is the parent grape of both\n Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, often used in blended wines. Cabernet Franc originated in the Bordeaux\n region of France and to honor that provenance, we age our 2019 Jessup Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon in\n 80% new French oak for 22 months. Alcohol content in this varietal is 14.9% with a PH of 3.65. You can\n purchase our 2019 Cab for $90. The palate of the wine matches the aromatics providing juicy fruit flavors,\n rich tannins and a long finish. This wine drinks well now however will age gracefully for the next 5-8\n years. Enjoy this Cabernet Sauvignon with a quality cut of beef or any dish that has a nice smoky/fatty/or\n charred quality.\n Jessup Cellars has also created a 2018 Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon with 96.5% Cabernet\n grapes, finished with 3.5% Napa Valley Petite Sirah fruit. This wine has a very different nose and mouth\n feel than our 2019 Cabernet, presenting a dry, more tannic finish which still feels young but full bodied as\n it crosses your palate. You could lay this bottle down for another 5-8 years as you wait for it to soften, but\n if you want to drink it now, we encourage you to pair this wine with a nice Filet Mignon or other red meat.\n Our Alexander Valley Cabernet is aged in 80% new French oak with an alcohol content of 14.9% and may\n be purchased for $90 for non-members.\n 2019 GRAZIELLA SANGIOVESE BLEND is sold out\n $95.00\n \"Graziella\" is one of the most unique wines that we produce. This harmonious blend of Sangiovese and\n Cabernet Sauvignon is one of our smallest production wines which makes it a very special treat for\n whoever is able to get their hands on it! Our 2019 \"Graziella\" showcases a perfect balance on the nose\n and palate, expressing aromas and flavors of strawberry, red plum, raspberry, vanilla, and rose petal.\n The mouthfeel is bright and has just the right amount of acidity which makes this wine a wonderful\n compliment to a variety of dishes. Pair \"Graziella\" with red sauce dishes like lasagna or spiced meat\n dishes like lamb with rosemary. Drink now or cellar this wine for another 5-8 years to see how beautifully\n it develops.\n WINEMAKER NOTES\n Composition: 75% Sangiovese, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon\n Appellation: Napa Valley\n Aging: 15 months in French oak\n Alcohol: 14.9%\n PH: 3.6\n Jessup Cellars 2019 Juel Red Wine is one exploration of the ultimate 'Art of the Blend' expression. Juel is\n named in homage to the Father of one of our owner families which is of Swiss origin. Our winemakers\n have built a Jessup favorite with this wine composed of 56% Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon and 14%\n Cabernet Franc, with Merlot figuring heavily into the blend at 24% from our Truchard Vineyard fruit. The\n wine is finished with 2% each of Petite Sirah, Petite Verdot and Malbec, all from the Napa Valley. Jessup\n Cellars' 2019 \"Juel\" Blend is a harmonious composition of varietals, a testament to the artistry of\n winemaking. This wine is a celebration of balance, with its blend of dark fruit, baking spices, and earthy\nelements coming together in perfect unison. Approachable yet age-worthy, \"Juel\" is a sensory journey\n that invites you to savor the intricacies of each sip. Pour a glass, and let the symphony unfold. The\n non-member price for Juel is $115. Juel is aged in 70% new French oak for 22 months with 14.9% alcohol\n by volume. The PH is 3.65.\n 2019 TABLE FOR FOUR CABERNETBLEND\n $115.00\n \"Table for Four\" is our celebrated and signature Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend and is anxiously\n anticipated by both guests and staff alike each year upon its release. Our 2019 vintage carries on the\n tradition of comprising a wine of distinction and depth, with layers of complexity to titillate any wine\n enthusiast. With notes of ripe black cherry and blackberry on the nose, the luscious fruit is accompanied\n by warm and inviting aromas of baking spice and dark cacao. An intriguing layer of subtle floral and\n herbal undertones enhances the complexity, with violet, anise, and a hint of spearmint adding nuance to\n this incredible profile. The palate sings with harmony as the fruit and spice components interplay, and\n fine, compact tannins give this wine the structural integrity to age for many years to come. With a lovely\n lingering finish, enjoy this wine now for a vibrant experience on the palate, or cellar it to increase its\n nuance in years to come.\n WINEMAKER NOTES\n Composition: 61.8% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26.5% Cabernet Franc, 4.2% Petite Verdot, 3.5% Petite Sirah,\n 2.7% Malbec, 1.1% Merlot\n Appellation: 100% Napa Valley\n Aging: 22 months in 70% new french oak\n ABV: 14.9%\n PH3.65\n Jessup Cellars has introduced our first estate grown 100% Petite Sirah beginning with the 2021 vintage\n as a standalone wine, while also using it extensively in our 'Art of the Blend' winemaking process going\n forward. Our 2021 Petite Sirah offers a captivating sensory journey with a complex blend of flavors and\n aromas. The wine opens with luscious notes of blueberry and tart cherry, creating a vibrant and fruity\n introduction. Pomegranate adds a touch of brightness, complemented by the subtle sweetness of brown\n sugar and the deep richness of cassis. The influence of bourbon and sour mash emerges, contributing a\n layer of complexity with hints of oak and a delightful cake batter essence. Notes of plum jam adds a\n comforting touch of sweetness, while cracked pepper brings a subtle spice that enhances the overall\n profile.The wine showcases robust yet approachable tannins, providing a structured backbone that\n promises aging potential. Bright acidity adds a refreshing quality, balancing the richness of the fruit and\n contributing to the wine's overall harmony. The finish is long and satisfying, leaving lingering impressions\n of cedar, licorice, and the delicate essence of raspberry. To say the least, there is a lot going on with this\n sublime wine. This wine is aged for 22 months in a mix of used (neutral) French and American barrels\n and is our \"hottest\" wine with an alcohol content of 15.6% with a PH of 3.65.\n Our estate vineyard in the Wooden Valley of Southeastern Napa County will be the foundation for our\n continued growth in the Napa Valley.\n Fortified and Port Style Wines\n Jessup Cellars makes a few fortified vintages of their Zinfandel Port and offers a 100% Cabernet\n Sauvignon dessert wine. Jessup Cellars is currently offering our 2013 100% Zinfandel Port fortified with\n Brandy. Some of the most unique and long-lived wines in the World are Port wines. Paying homage to\n tradition, Jessup Cellars has always been known for making quality small batches of Port style wines from\n Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes. The 2013 Zinfandel Port is just another phenomenal addition\n to that family. Boasting bold aromatics of ripe raspberry, leather, and spice on the nose, followed by\n vanilla and red plum that dances on the palate. The finish is strong yet balanced making this a perfect\n match for blue cheese, dark chocolate or a Maduro cigar. Drink now or cellar for 7-10 years. This\n delicious wine has an alcohol content of 19.5%, so a little goes a long way. Pricing is $65 dollars for\n non-members.\n 13th Reflection Tawny dessert wine. Crafted in the traditional Solera method, this rich and lush dessert\nwine offers pronounced aromas of stewed cherry, dried fig, chocolate, and baking spice with a kiss of\n sandalwood and cedar. A decadent and juicy palate of mixed berry preserves will make a perfect digestif\n after a rich meal. Deliciously sweet yet fresh,this wine will pair with desserts like chocolate lava cake or a\n cheese course of ripe, aged, salty cheeses. Enjoy it now or cellar for 10-15 years. The Infinite Reflection\n 13th Recursion is 100% Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon aged for 12 years in French oak with an\n alcohol content of 19.5%. Non-members may purchase this wine for $85.\n The Solera method is a traditional aging and blending process commonly used in the production of\n fortified wines, including dessert wines like Sherry and Madeira. Here's how it works:\n Tiered Stacking: The process begins with a series of barrels or casks arranged in a tiered system called a\n \"solera stack.\" The bottom row contains the oldest wine, while subsequent rows contain progressively\n younger wines. Fractional Blending: Each year, a portion of wine is drawn from the bottom row of barrels\n for bottling. This creates space in those barrels, which are then topped up with wine from the row above.\n The process continues up the stack, with each barrel being partially emptied and then replenished with\n younger wine. Aging and Maturity: Because the barrels are only partially emptied each year, a portion of\n the older wine always remains in the barrels, contributing to the complexity and depth of flavor. Over time,\n the younger wines gradually blend with and inherit characteristics from the older wines.\n Consistency: The Solera method ensures consistency in the final product, as the blend of wines remains\n relatively constant over time. Even though some wine is removed for bottling each year, the overall\n character of the solera remains consistent due to the blending of older and younger wines.\n Perpetual Process: The Solera system is designed to be perpetual, with new wine continuously added at\n the top and matured wine drawn from the bottom for bottling. This allows producers to maintain a\n consistent product while also ensuring that some of the original wine remains in the solera stack,\n sometimes for many years or even decades. Overall, the Solera method is a meticulous and\n time-honored process that results in complex, well-balanced dessert wines with layers of flavor and\n aroma.\n Tasting Experiences\n Jessup Cellars offers many experiences for enjoying our wines.

Non-members may purchase this wine for $85.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"question\": \"What is the Solera method of dessert wine creation?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The Solera method is a traditional aging and blending process commonly used in the production of fortified wines, including dessert wines like Sherry and Madeira. Here's how it works:\\nTiered Stacking: The process begins with a series of barrels or casks arranged in a tiered system called a \\\"solera stack.\\\" The bottom row contains the oldest wine, while subsequent rows contain progressively younger wines.\\nFractional Blending: Each year, a portion of wine is drawn from the bottom row of barrels for bottling. This creates space in those barrels, which are then topped up with wine from the row above. The process continues up the stack, with each barrel being partially emptied and then replenished with younger wine.\\nAging and Maturity: Because the barrels are only partially emptied each year, a portion of the older wine always remains in the barrels, contributing to the complexity and depth of flavor. Over time, the younger wines gradually blend with and inherit characteristics from the older wines.\\nConsistency: The Solera method ensures consistency in the final product, as the blend of wines remains relatively constant over time. Even though some wine is removed for bottling each year, the overall character of the solera remains consistent due to the blending of older and younger wines.\\nPerpetual Process: The Solera system is designed to be perpetual, with new wine continuously added at the top and matured wine drawn from the bottom for bottling. This allows producers to maintain a consistent product while also ensuring that some of the original wine remains in the solera stack, sometimes for many years or even decades.\\nOverall, the Solera method is a meticulous and time-honored process that results in complex, well-balanced dessert wines with layers of flavor and aroma.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"question\": \"What tasting experiences are available at Jessup Cellars?\",\n        \"answer\": \"Jessup Cellars offers many experiences for enjoying our wines.
